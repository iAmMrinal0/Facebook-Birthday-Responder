# Facebook-Birthday-Responder
Automatic responder to birthday wishes posted on your Facebook profile.

I wrote this when I had gotten my hands bit deep into web development and wanted to learn the Facebook API(v2.0 at that point.) It was working perfectly fine until Facebook changed their API(v5.0 as now) and I never got the chance to look back at this project. Maybe in the near future I probably will update it.

Until then feel free to check the code. And don't worry about the app key and app secret, they are no longer valid. :wink:
