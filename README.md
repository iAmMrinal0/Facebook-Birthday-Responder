# Facebook-Birthday-Responder
Automatic responder to birthday wishes posted on your Facebook profile.

I wrote this when I had gotten my hands bit deep into web development and wanted to learn the Facebook API(v2.0 at that point.) It was working perfectly fine until Facebook updated their API(v5.0 as now) and I never got the chance to look back at this project. Maybe in the near future I probably will update it or write it in a different language.

Until then feel free to check the code. And don't worry about the app key and app secret, they are no longer valid. :wink:

PS: This was my first git based project so cut me some slack if you read the commit messages, nevertheless have a good laugh. :laughing:
